machine learning models can identify patterns and trends associated with fraud by analyzing large amounts of transactional data. These models can learn from past data to detect deviations and anomalies from normal spending patterns. For instance, large transactions, unusual locations, or atypical shopping hours could be potential indicators of fraud.
